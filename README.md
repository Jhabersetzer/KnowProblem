# KnowProblem
KnowProblem is a virtual platform designed to bring together those with problems (legal, financial, health, etc.) and those who can solve these problems (lawyers, cpaâ€™s, health professionals, etc.). A user simply puts a description of their problem into the Problem Portal, which is then sent into a pool of outstanding problems.  These outstanding problems are separated and organized based upon the professional service required to complete the problem (lawyers, physical therapists, etc.).  Professional members peruse through these problems and select the ones they are interested in.  

Once this selection is made, a connection is created between the user or poster of the problem, and the professional interested in providing a solution or assistance.  This connection appears alongside other connections, allowing the user to communicate and eventually choose the perfect professional through them based on factors like a quoted price, strength of professional profile and resume, and actual live conversation between the two parties.
Once a specific professional is selected, the professional will send a description of the agreement with a set price, to which the user can accept and transfer payment over our platform. Our platform then holds the payment in escrow until completion of the work by the professional.
